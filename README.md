# Usage - Developers
First of all, users need to be connected to a common network. it can be a Hotspot, etc.
Then, one of the users should be the host and run the script as following:
```bash
python run.py 0.0.0.0 5000 false
```
then everyone in the network can connect using the address made by program.<br>
